                <h2>Alcohol, Drugs, And Socializing</h2>
                <br><p class="para">I wrote this article because while doing research for the site I'd occasionally come across references, questions, or discussions about how alcohol or various drugs affected the way people socialized. But as far as I could tell no one else had written a central article about it, so I thought I'd put up a fairly quick, basic overview of my own. I believe the topic is worth discussing. Substance use is a facet of socializing people sometimes wonder about. And I don't think drugs should be seen as a scary, taboo topic.</p>

                <h2>What Do People Actually Do At Parties?</h2>
                <br><p class="para">This is one of those articles about a supposedly "super-basic topic that everybody already knows about". The fact is some people don't know "obvious" things, and if you're one of them you may feel embarrassed about admitting it and asking for help. Luckily, you can always turn to the internet. The fact that this article exists shows you're not the only one with this particular question. </p>

                <h2>Do Therapists Psychoanalyze People In Everyday Life?</h2>
                <br><p class="para">People in many professions have common questions, comments, and jokes they hear when they tell people what they do. For psychotherapists one is, "Are you analyzing me right now?" Sometimes the person says it as a joke. At other times there's a hint of worry, like they fear the therapist will quickly learn their deepest insecurities and judge them on it.

                    As a counselor myself, here's my take on the question. Do we casually psychoanalyze people? Usually not, but if we do, it's not in a way you need to be concerned about.</p>
