                <h2>MICROCHIP INTRODUCES VOLTAGE REFERENCE ICS FOR EXTENDED TEMPERATURE AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS</h2>
                <br><p class="para">Extended-temperature-range voltage reference ICs for automotive and industrial applications require low drift, high reliability, and high performance. Microchip Technology has announced the release of a high-precision voltage reference (Vref) IC that meets these needs at a cost-effective price. The new MCP1502 is an AEC-Q100 Grade 1 automotive-qualified Vref with a maximum temperature coefficient of 7 ppm/°C.</p>

                <h2>Facebook Open-sources Its Newest Hardware, the Time Appliance Project</h2>
                <br><p class="para">Recently, Facebook released the Time Card, an open-source x86 PCIe interface card designed to provide accurate synchronization at tens of nanoseconds. The Time Appliance Project includes all of the hardware on the Time Card and is intended to speed up data centers.<br>Central to the design of this card is the RCB-F9T timing board from u-blox. u-blox’s ZED-F9T multi-band timing module is also said to be a key technology in Facebook’s newest hardware project. 

                    In collaboration with Open Compute, Facebook has launched the Time Appliances Project (TAP) with the intent to fully open-source this project and address many of the issues involved with proprietary time devices.</p>

                <h2>Two AI Processors Push Computer Vision to the Next Level for IoT and Automotives</h2>
                <br><p class="para">Between booming fields like autonomous vehicles and robotics, computer vision has become one of the hottest applications of artificial intelligence. Arguably more so than other AI applications, computer vision relies heavily on the underlying hardware, where software performance can be limited by the underlying processing units and imaging systems. <br>For this reason, EEs across the board are focused on pushing the boundaries of state-of-the-art and developing the best vision hardware possible. To go along with this push, multiple smaller-name companies, specifically Syntiant and Intuitive, have been aiming to make headlines. </p>
