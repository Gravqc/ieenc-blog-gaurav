# My First Web Project - Basic HTML/CSS Site

## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to my first-ever web development project! This website is a foray into the world of HTML and CSS, built from scratch as a learning experience. It showcases various pages that cover topics from electronics to machine learning, along with miscellaneous content.

## 🛠️ Installation
No installation is required. To view the website, simply open the HTML files in any web browser.

**Files Included:**
- `index.html` - The homepage of the website.
- `electronics.html` - A page dedicated to electronics content.
- `Machinelearning.html` - A page focusing on machine learning topics.
- `MISCELLANEOUS.html` - A page for various other interesting topics.
- `tut2.css` - The stylesheet that contains the CSS rules for the website.

## 👨‍🏫 Get Started
To get started with this project:
1. Download all the HTML and CSS files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the homepage.
3. Navigate through the site using the links provided on the homepage to access other pages.

## 🎨 Styling
The styling is defined within the `tut2.css` file and is applied across all the HTML pages to maintain a consistent look and feel. The CSS file includes basic styling such as font sizes, colors, and layout properties.

## 📝 Note
This project marks my first steps into web development. With basic HTML and CSS, I've constructed a multi-page website that has laid the foundation for my future learning and growth in this field.
